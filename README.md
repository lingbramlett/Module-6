# Weather Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes weather patterns using OpenWeatherMap API data. 
It includes two main analyses:

1. **WeatherPy.ipynb** - Retrieves and analyzes weather data.
2. **VacationPy.ipynb** - Uses weather data to recommend vacation spots.

## Files Included
- `WeatherPy.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for weather data analysis.
- `VacationPy.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for vacation location analysis.
- `cities.csv`: Contains city weather data.
- `Fig1.png` - `Fig4.png`: Visualizations of weather trends.
- `api_keys.py`: Stores API keys (You must replace `"YOUR KEY HERE"` with your actual API key).

## How to Use
1. Add your OpenWeatherMap API key to `api_keys.py`.
2. Run `WeatherPy.ipynb` to fetch and analyze weather data.
3. Run `VacationPy.ipynb` to find vacation destinations based on weather conditions.

## Requirements
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenWeatherMap API
